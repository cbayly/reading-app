cd backend
npm run dev
```

**Terminal 2 - Frontend:**

### Database

The database has been initialized with:
- Sample students (from The Office TV show)
- WPM benchmarks for different grade levels
- All necessary tables and relationships

### Important Notes

1. **OpenAI API Key**: You need to add your own OpenAI API key to `backend/.env`:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY="your-actual-openai-api-key-here"
   ```

2. **First Login**: Use the following credentials to log in:
   - Email: `cam@example.com`

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **Port conflicts**: Make sure ports 3000 and 5050 are available
2. **Database issues**: Run `cd backend && npx prisma migrate reset` to reset the database
3. **Dependencies**: Run `npm install` in both `backend/` and `frontend/` directories
4. **OpenAI errors**: Ensure your API key is valid and has sufficient credits

### Next Steps

1. Add your OpenAI API key to `backend/.env`
2. Start the application using `./start-app.sh`
3. Navigate to http://localhost:3000
4. Log in with the provided credentials
5. Start creating reading assessments and weekly plans!
