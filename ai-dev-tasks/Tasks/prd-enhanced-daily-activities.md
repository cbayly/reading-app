## Key Design Decisions

### Interaction Methods (Mobile vs Desktop)
**Decision**: Use **tap-to-select alternatives on mobile** instead of drag-and-drop everywhere
**Rationale**: 
- Drag-and-drop on mobile can be frustrating for young readers
- Tap interactions are more intuitive on touch devices  
- Better accessibility for students with motor skill differences
- More reliable across different mobile browsers

### Progress Persistence Strategy
**Decision**: Use **backend database for cross-device sync** as primary storage
**Rationale**:
- Students can continue activities on different devices (tablet at home, computer at school)
- Prevents progress loss if browser storage is cleared
- Aligns with existing backend infrastructure
- Enables future parent/teacher dashboards

## Design Considerations

### Visual Design
- **Consistent Styling**: Use existing Tailwind CSS classes to match current application design
- **Color Coding**: Implement consistent color scheme (indigo for selection, emerald for correct, amber/rose for incorrect)
- **Card-Based Layout**: Activities should use card-based layouts with proper spacing and shadows
- **Clear Typography**: Ensure readable fonts and appropriate sizing for young readers

### Interaction Patterns
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Show help text and feedback contextually
- **Error Prevention**: Disable invalid actions (e.g., submitting empty forms)
- **Clear Actions**: Use descriptive button text and icons where helpful

### Accessibility
- **WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance**: Meet accessibility standards for educational software
- **Focus Management**: Proper focus order and visible focus indicators
- **Alternative Text**: All images and icons must have descriptive alt text

## Technical Considerations

### Frontend Implementation
- **Component Architecture**: Build reusable activity components that can be composed
- **State Management**: Use React hooks for local state, backend API for persistence
- **Device Detection**: Implement responsive design patterns and touch detection
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation when content generation fails

### Backend Integration
- **Content Generation API**: Extend existing OpenAI integration to generate activity-specific content
- **Progress Tracking**: Store activity progress in existing database schema
- **Caching Strategy**: Cache generated content to reduce API costs and improve performance
- **Error Recovery**: Fallback to pre-seeded content when AI generation fails

### Database Schema
- **Activity Responses**: Store student responses for each activity type
- **Generated Content**: Cache AI-generated characters, settings, events, and vocabulary
- **Progress State**: Track completion status and timestamps for each activity

## Success Metrics

### Engagement Metrics
- **Completion Rate**: >85% of students who start activities complete all 6 steps
- **Time on Task**: Average 15-20 minutes per complete activity session
- **Return Rate**: >70% of students return to complete activities if interrupted

### Educational Effectiveness

## Open Questions

1. **Content Review Process**: Do we need a manual review step for AI-generated content before it's shown to students?

2. **Activity Retry Policy**: Should students be able to restart individual activities or only the entire session?

3. **Accessibility Testing**: What specific accessibility testing should be conducted with actual students?

4. **Content Moderation**: How should we handle inappropriate content that might be extracted from stories?

5. **Performance Monitoring**: What specific metrics should be tracked to monitor the AI content generation performance?

6. **Mobile App Integration**: Should this system be designed to eventually work in a mobile app, or web-only?
