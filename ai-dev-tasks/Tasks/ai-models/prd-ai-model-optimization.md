# Product Requirements Document: AI Model Optimization by Content Type

## Introduction/Overview

Currently, the reading app generates various types of content using AI models, including short stories, reading assessments, and daily tasks. To improve content quality, generation speed, and cost efficiency, we need to implement content-type-specific AI model selection. This feature will allow the system to use the most appropriate AI model for each type of content generation, leveraging the strengths of different models for optimal results.

## Goals

1. Implement content-type-specific AI model selection to improve content quality
2. Optimize generation speed for different content types
3. Establish a foundation for future cost monitoring and optimization
4. Provide development/testing override capabilities for model experimentation
5. Create a scalable system that can accommodate future model additions

## User Stories

**As a student,** I want to receive higher quality, more engaging short stories so that I'm more motivated to read and complete my weekly plans.

**As a parent,** I want my child to have access to well-structured, grade-appropriate reading assessments so that the evaluations accurately reflect their reading abilities.

**As a student,** I want varied and engaging daily tasks that are appropriately challenging so that I can improve my reading skills progressively.

**As a developer,** I want to be able to test different AI models for content generation so that I can optimize the system's performance.

**As a system administrator,** I want to monitor AI usage and costs so that I can make informed decisions about resource allocation.

## Functional Requirements

1. **Model Configuration System**
   - The system must support configuring different AI models for different content types
   - Short story creation must use GPT-4o model
   - Assessment creation (reading passages and comprehension questions) must use GPT-4-turbo model
   - Daily task generation must use GPT-4-turbo model

2. **Development Override Capability**
   - The system must provide a way to override model selection for testing/development purposes
   - Override mechanism should be easily configurable without code changes
   - Override should be clearly documented and logged when used

3. **Logging and Monitoring**
   - The system must log which AI model is used for each content generation request
   - The system should track basic usage metrics (number of requests per model, per content type)
   - The system should log model-specific errors separately for troubleshooting

4. **Error Handling and Fallback**
   - The system must handle cases where the specified model is unavailable
   - A basic fallback mechanism should be implemented (specifics TBD)
   - Model-specific errors should be logged with sufficient detail for debugging

5. **Cost Tracking Foundation**
   - The system should log data necessary for future cost analysis
   - Each API call should be tracked with model type, content type, and timestamp
   - Token usage should be logged when available from the API response

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

1. **Advanced Configuration UI** - No admin interface for changing model configurations
2. **A/B Testing Framework** - Not implementing comparative testing capabilities at this time
3. **Content Migration** - No migration of existing content generated with previous models
4. **Granular Model Selection** - No per-grade-level or per-student model customization
5. **Real-time Cost Monitoring** - No live cost dashboards or alerts (data collection only)
6. **Backwards Compatibility** - No requirement to maintain compatibility with content from previous models

## Design Considerations

- **Configuration Location**: Model configurations should be easily accessible for developers (e.g., environment variables, configuration files, or constants)
- **Code Organization**: Model selection logic should be centralized to avoid duplication
- **Logging Format**: Use structured logging to facilitate future analysis
- **Development Experience**: Override mechanism should be simple and well-documented

## Technical Considerations

- **API Integration**: Ensure the OpenAI client library supports all specified models
- **Error Handling**: Different models may have different error patterns and rate limits
- **Performance**: GPT-4-turbo should provide faster responses for assessments and daily tasks
- **Token Limits**: Different models may have different token limits that need to be considered
- **Rate Limiting**: Each model may have different rate limits that need to be managed

## Success Metrics

1. **Content Quality**: Subjective improvement in story engagement and assessment accuracy (to be evaluated manually initially)
2. **Generation Speed**: Measurable improvement in response times for assessments and daily tasks
3. **System Reliability**: No increase in generation failures or errors
4. **Developer Experience**: Successful implementation without breaking existing functionality
5. **Foundation for Future Optimization**: Successful data collection for cost analysis

## Open Questions

1. **Current Model Discovery**: What AI model(s) are currently being used across the system?
2. **Fallback Strategy**: What should be the specific fallback model if the primary model fails?
3. **Rate Limiting**: Are there specific rate limits or quotas we need to consider for each model?
4. **Testing Strategy**: How should we validate that the new models are producing expected results?
5. **Configuration Method**: What's the preferred method for model configuration (environment variables, config files, database)?
6. **Cost Monitoring Details**: What specific metrics should we track for future cost analysis?
7. **Error Recovery**: Should there be automatic retry logic with different models?
8. **Performance Benchmarks**: What are the current baseline performance metrics for content generation?

## Implementation Priority

**Phase 1 (MVP)**:
- Implement basic model selection per content type
- Add logging for model usage and basic error handling
- Implement simple development override mechanism

**Phase 2 (Future)**:
- Enhanced cost tracking and analysis
- Advanced fallback strategies
- Performance optimization based on collected data
