# Product Requirements Document: Parent Sign-Up Flow

## Introduction/Overview

The Parent Sign-Up Flow is the foundational onboarding experience for our reading assessment platform. This feature enables parents of grade 3-7 students to create accounts, add their children's profiles, and prepare for personalized reading assessments. The flow solves the critical problem of parents needing a structured way to track their child's reading progress through an intuitive, secure onboarding process.

## Goals

1. **Streamline Parent Onboarding**: Reduce friction in account creation and student setup to under 5 minutes total completion time
2. **Capture Essential Student Data**: Collect student information (name, grade, interests) needed for personalized AI-generated reading assessments
3. **Establish Secure Authentication**: Implement robust parent authentication using Supabase Auth with proper validation
4. **Enable Multi-Child Support**: Allow parents to add unlimited children to their account
5. **Prepare for Assessment**: Guide parents to the reading assessment entry point after successful setup

## User Stories

**As a parent**, I want to create an account quickly so that I can start tracking my child's reading progress.

**As a parent**, I want to add multiple children to one account so that I can manage all my kids' reading assessments in one place.

**As a parent**, I want to provide my child's interests so that their reading assessments are engaging and personalized.

**As a parent**, I want clear guidance on next steps so that I understand how to proceed with the reading assessment.

**As a returning parent**, I want to log in easily so that I can access my existing student profiles and data.

## Functional Requirements

### Landing Page & Authentication
1. The system must display a landing page with clear value proposition: "Get Started – Help Your Child Read Better"
2. The system must provide two primary CTAs: "Sign Up" (new parent) and "Log In" (returning parent)
3. The system must include compelling copy explaining the reading assessment benefits

### Account Creation
4. The system must display a registration form with fields: Parent Name, Email, Password, Confirm Password
5. The system must validate email uniqueness in real-time
6. The system must enforce password requirements: minimum 8 characters with complexity rules
7. The system must require password confirmation matching
8. The system must include Terms of Service & Privacy Policy acceptance checkbox (required)
9. The system must integrate with Supabase Auth for account creation
10. The system must hash and securely store passwords via Supabase Auth
11. The system must create a new Parent record in the database upon successful registration
12. The system must redirect to login page if email already exists, with "Forgot Password" option

### Student Setup
13. The system must guide parents to add at least one child after successful account creation
14. The system must display student setup form with fields: Child's Name (required), Age (optional), Grade Level (required), Interests (optional, multi-select or text)
15. The system must require Grade Level selection from grades 3-7
16. The system must create Student record linked to Parent.id in database
17. The system must store interests as an array in the Student table
18. The system must provide "Add Another Child" option allowing unlimited student additions
19. The system must use friendly copy: "Let's meet your reader!"
20. The system must block dashboard access until at least one child is added

### Assessment Preparation
21. The system must display "Start First Reading Check" CTA after student setup completion
22. The system must explain the assessment: "~10–15 minutes, adaptive difficulty, helps personalize weekly reading"
23. The system must create new Assessment record for the student when starting
24. The system must show assessment intro screen before beginning

### Error Handling & Edge Cases
25. The system must handle incomplete student setup by preventing dashboard access
26. The system must allow assessment resumption from last completed question if abandoned
27. The system must provide clear error messages for validation failures
28. The system must handle network errors gracefully with retry options

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- **Assessment Logic Implementation**: The actual reading assessment questions, scoring, and adaptive difficulty algorithms will be developed separately
- **Dashboard Functionality**: Post-assessment dashboard features and reading progress tracking
- **Email Verification**: Optional for MVP, recommended for future security enhancement  
- **Social Login**: Google/Apple authentication not included in initial version
- **Payment Processing**: No subscription or payment features in this flow
- **Teacher/School Accounts**: Focus solely on parent-student relationships

## Design Considerations

- **Mobile-First Design**: Optimize for mobile devices as primary parent interaction method
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Break complex forms into digestible steps with clear progress indicators
- **Friendly Tone**: Use encouraging, supportive copy throughout the flow
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Emphasize primary CTAs and de-emphasize secondary actions
- **Accessibility**: Ensure WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for form labels, color contrast, and keyboard navigation
- **Trust Signals**: Include security badges and privacy assurances during account creation

## Technical Considerations

- **Authentication**: Integrate Supabase Auth for user management and security
- **Database Structure**: 
  - Parent table (id, name, email, created_at)
  - Student table (id, parent_id, name, age, grade_level, interests[], created_at)
  - Assessment table (id, student_id, status, created_at)
- **Row-Level Security**: Implement RLS to ensure parents can only access their own student data
- **Data Validation**: Server-side validation for all form inputs
- **State Management**: Handle multi-step flow state persistence
- **Error Logging**: Implement comprehensive error tracking for debugging

## Success Metrics

1. **Sign-up Completion Rate**: Target 85% completion rate from landing page to first student added
2. **Time to Completion**: Average onboarding time under 5 minutes
3. **Form Abandonment Points**: Track where users drop off in the flow
4. **Multi-Child Adoption**: Percentage of parents who add 2+ children
5. **Assessment Initiation Rate**: Percentage of completed sign-ups who start the reading assessment

## Open Questions

1. **Email Verification**: Should we implement email verification for MVP or defer to post-launch?
2. **Password Reset Flow**: What's the desired password reset experience using Supabase Auth?
3. **Data Migration**: How should we handle users who want to transfer data between accounts?
4. **Grade Level Validation**: Should we validate student age against grade level for consistency?
5. **Interest Categories**: Should we provide predefined interest categories or allow free-form text input?
6. **Assessment Scheduling**: Should parents be able to schedule assessments for later or must they start immediately?
